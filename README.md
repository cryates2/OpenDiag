# OpenOBFD
Open source OBDII scanner/simple diagnostic software for Ford vehicles. 
Still in infancy, I only plan on including Ford/Mercury/Lincoln vehicles at the moment.
Most if not all of my effort will be going towards getting this up and running on Linux.
Beyond that I'll start thinking about Windows and other manufacturers after I am satisfied with the above.
